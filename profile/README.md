DSRemapper stands for (Device Switcher and Remapper) and it's a modular app that can remap almost any input device in a computer into an output device (usually virtual, but can be physical).

This controller remap occurs inside a Remapper plugin, which can be simple or complex, giving the user great flexibility to reasign it's devices in any way.
